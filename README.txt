The game I created is finished with full testing. The logic for comparing hand cards is a point system which score each hand based on its card, full explanation is in the comment in Hand.java. It's far from the perfect system but I tried my best to account for everything except for extreme situations, mostly in the flush vs flush hands. The test file is made by maven on vscode but the final product is made in a regular project type. Other than what I've said everything is tested and working properly.
